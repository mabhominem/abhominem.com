	<h1>About Ab Hominem</h1>
	<p>Antibody Therapeutics remain a powerful tool in the treatment of disease, and we hope to better educate people of both scientific and non-scientific backgrounds on the ongoing developments in the field. Through better awareness more people may benefit from these kinds of therapies.test2
  <p>Over the last three decades since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muromonab-CD3">first antibody</a> was approved by the FDA, vast improvements have been made in the field of antibody therapeutics. Today antibodies are used to treat cancer, infections, autoimmunity, Alzheimerâ€™s, toxins and many other damaging if not fatal medical problems. However the subtle engineering feats that go into the design of these therapeutics, their functional properties, and their targets, often go unnoticed or unappreciated. We hope to provide a place to summarize ongoing developments in the field, discussing both success and failures, as well as describe how current treatments function or might be improved through antibody based therapies.</p>
